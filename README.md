# Auto Reply Calls 📱

An Android app that automatically sends SMS replies to missed calls based on your current status. Never leave callers hanging when you're busy, in a meeting, driving, or at lunch!

## ✨ Features

- **🍽️ At Lunch** - "Hey! I'm at lunch right now. Will call you back shortly."
- **📋 In Meeting** - "I'm currently in a meeting and can't take calls. I'll get back to you as soon as I'm free."
- **🚗 Driving** - "I'm driving right now and can't answer. I'll call you back when I reach safely."
- **🔕 Busy** - "I'm a bit busy at the moment. Will return your call soon!"
- **✍️ Custom** - Set your own personalized message

### Additional Features
- **One-tap status switching** - Quickly change your status with a single tap
- **Spam prevention** - Won't send multiple messages to the same number within 5 minutes
- **Works in background** - No need to keep the app open
- **Auto-signature** - Messages include "-Sent from Auto Reply Calls"

## 🤔 Problem It Solves

We've all been there:
- You're in an important meeting and can't answer
- You're driving and it's unsafe (and illegal!) to pick up
- You're at lunch with friends and don't want to be rude
- You're simply busy and will call back later

Without this app, callers are left wondering if you're ignoring them. **Auto Reply Calls** instantly lets them know you saw their call and will get back to them!

## 🏗️ How It Works

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│   Incoming      │     │   CallReceiver   │     │   SmsSender     │
│   Call          │ ──► │   (Broadcast     │ ──► │   (Sends SMS    │
│                 │     │    Receiver)     │     │    with status) │
└─────────────────┘     └──────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
         │                       │
         │                       ▼
         │              ┌──────────────────┐
         │              │ PreferencesManager│
         │              │ (Checks if       │
         │              │  enabled + spam) │
         │              └──────────────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│  RINGING → IDLE │
│  (Missed Call!) │
└─────────────────┘
```

1. **CallReceiver** listens for phone state changes
2. Detects missed calls (RINGING → IDLE without answering)
3. **PreferencesManager** checks if auto-reply is enabled and spam prevention
4. **SmsSender** sends the appropriate status message via SMS

## 📋 Required Permissions

| Permission | Why It's Needed |
|------------|-----------------|
| `READ_PHONE_STATE` | To detect incoming calls |
| `READ_CALL_LOG` | To identify the caller's number |
| `SEND_SMS` | To send the auto-reply message |

### 🛠️ Step-by-Step Guide to Enable SMS Permissions on Android 15 or later

1. **Open App Info:**
   * **Quick Way:** Long-press the app icon and tap **App info** (or the 'i' icon).
   * **Settings Way:** Go to **Settings** > **Apps** > **See all apps** > Select the app.

2. **Allow Restricted Settings:**
   * On the **App Info** page, tap the **three vertical dots (⋮)** in the top-right corner.
   * Select **"Allow restricted settings"**.
   * *Note: You may be prompted to enter your device PIN or use biometric authentication to confirm.*

3. **Grant SMS Permissions:**
   * Once restricted settings are enabled, go back to the **Permissions** section within the App Info page.
   * Find **SMS** (likely under the "Not allowed" section).
   * Tap **SMS** and change the setting to **"Allow"**.

*This should resolve the permission block. Let me know if you're still seeing the 'Restricted' dialogue after following these steps!*
